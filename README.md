# Portfolio
Professional Portfolio

In this assignment I created a home page to my personal portfolio from scratch. As I complete projects I will be able to use this page to showcase them to potential employers. This web application utilizes navigation links, media queries, and CSS variables. As I progress as a web developer I will update this porfolio to look more professional.
